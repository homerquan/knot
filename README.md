knot
====

A graph computing engine on top of mongoDB

Background

In big data age, the amount of data alone can not represent the value of those data. But also HOW DATA ORGANIZED. 
Well organized data can give rich picture and deep understand of your business and better way to leverage them to generante  rich features at low cost.  

Graph DB is a promising technology for better data organizing. Comparing to exisiting graph DBs, knot is trying to build on more conviential tech stack, MongoDB. And provide standard graph query as them same as other graph db such as Neo4j. 

What is Knot

A graph data platform who can read/write standard graph such as json-ld and GraphML http://graphml.graphdrawing.org
Run graph algorithm and persistent on MangoDB

Goal:
  * Following paths of graph in conventional data storage (MangoDB)
  * Less memory trace
  * Standard query interface
  * An extentable graph algorithm set
